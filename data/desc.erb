<!-- Descriptions used in each glyph's main entry page. -->

#accept

A triangle with the point down, in the same direction as :self.

#not

Derived from the symbol for the &ldquo;not&rdquo; operator from Boolean algebra (&not;).

#simple

A single short line in contrast to the zigzag of :complex.

#complex

A zigzag in contrast to the single line of :simple.

#imperfect

This glyph is derived from the perfect bowtie of :truth, with two segments missing.

<p>Note that :imperfect can be impossible to draw correctly without realizing that
there's a hidden fifth segment between the top right and bottom left.  For more
information please refer to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ErinTurowski/posts/J2UP5bYo9Ey">this Google Plus post</a>.

#path

A bent line representing a possibly circuitous path.

<p>The glyph can be translated to the bottom right to form :destination.

<p>A mirror image of it along the outer hexagon of the grid forms the glyph :outside; it may also
be interpreted as :distance, which measures how long the path is.

#destination

A bent line along the outer hexagon of the grid.

<p>The glyph can be translated to the middle to form :path.

<p>A mirror image of it forms the glyph :distance/:outside.

#distance

A bent line along the outer hexagon of the grid.  It can be mirrored to form
two other glyphs: :path and :destination.

#outside

A bent line along the outer hexagon of the grid.  In contrast, its antonym :inside
is a bent line along the inner rectangle.

#inside

A bent line along the inner rectangle of the grid.  Its antonym :outside, in contrast,
is a bent line along the outer hexagon.

#grow

Essentially :gain mirrored vertically, with an extra segment emphasizing ascent.

#reduce

Essentially :lose mirrored vertically, with an extra segment emphasizing decline.
Attested only as a single-glyph phrase.

#share

The glyph for :share can be thought of as a squashed, wider version of :have &mdash;
which perhaps signifies distributing possessions to a wider group.

#unbounded

The glyph for :unbounded starts with :search and goes counter-clockwise around
the hexagonal grid.  Notice that it also resembles an infinite spiral starting
from the origin, and that it uses all the points in the grid.

#intelligence

The glyph for :intelligence is almost a mirror image of :difficult.

#difficult

The glyph for :difficult is almost a mirror image of :intelligence.

#technology

The glyph for :technology looks like a combination of :truth and :future, with
the right side of the bowtie removed.

#nzeer

Note that the glyphs for :nzeer and :resistance differ by only one moved segment.

#resistance

Note that the glyphs for :nzeer and :resistance differ by only one moved segment.
